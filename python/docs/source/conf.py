# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("."))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../.."))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "Saleae"
copyright = "2022, Saleae Inc"
author = "Ryan, John, and Mark"

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = "1.0.6"


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = ["sphinx.ext.autodoc", "sphinx_autodoc_typehints"]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ["_templates"]

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = []


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ["_static"]


# auto doc configuration

# Show docs for both init method and class overall
autoclass_content = "both"

# Only show the class's docstring in the class's documentation body.
# Without this, the __init__ signature will be shown in the header.
autoclass_content = "class"

# Display the __init__ method separate from the class header.
autodoc_class_signature = "separated"

# keep members ordered by source code.
autodoc_member_order = "bysource"
